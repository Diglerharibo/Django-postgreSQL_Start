# Django-postgreSQL_Start

⠀⠀⠀Recently, I started learn Django framework and postgreSQL, as I wrote in my previous repository. It was hard a bit to start but now I feel comfortable with getting new info. As a result, I would like to see some application **Django**, working on some sever, which operates some information **postgreSQL**. Everything I hope I could write on a **Python**.

⠀⠀⠀So wish I could beat it!
